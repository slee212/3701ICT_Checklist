#  Assignment 1
## Milestone 1

I learned:
- How to connect Xcode to github and create a repository.
- How to create and use a for each loop using swift
- How to create a list and add items through the for each
- How to use an HStack and export to subview
- How to find an image I want and implement it
- How to add an On Tap function

## Milestone 2

I learned:
- How to create a DataModel and initialise test data
- How to edit, add, and delete data within the data model (through the view)
- How to make changes persistent
- How to add new views and make an edit page
- How to use binding
- How to make a For Each loop with an index to be used later
- How to pass data between views

Things I struggled with:
- Make pages for each individual list with their list items. I made this work by using navigation links that took me to the ListView.

## Milestone 3

I learned:
- How to properly make a reset and undo button for my list
- How to create a boolean to use as a state
- Change the application icon
- How to re-order the list through .onMove

Things I struggled with:
- I could turn all ticked items to unticked, but couldn't retick using an undo button. I fixed this by using a temporary list to store the list before unticking all items.
